## üí° Tips and Strategies

### Beginner Tips

1. **Center Control**: The center cell (position 5) is the most powerful
2. **Corner Strategy**: Corners offer more winning combinations
3. **Block Opponent**: Always block if your opponent has 2 in a row
4. **Think Ahead**: Plan your next 2-3 moves
5. **Create Forks**: Try to create two winning threats at once

### Winning Strategies

**Opening Moves:**
- **Best first move**: Center (position 5) or corner (1, 3, 7, 9)
- **Avoid edges**: Edge cells (2, 4, 6, 8) are weaker opening moves

**Mid-game:**
- Look for opportunities to create multiple winning threats
- Force your opponent into defensive moves
- Control the center and corners

**Defense:**
- Always block opponent's winning moves
- Don't let opponent control opposite corners
- Watch for fork setups (two winning threats)

### Perfect Play

With perfect play from both sides, Tic-Tac-Toe always ends in a draw. The key is to:
1. Never make a mistake
2. Always block opponent's winning moves
3. Create threats when possible
4. Maintain center/corner control
